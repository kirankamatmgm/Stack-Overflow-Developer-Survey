## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

When I saw stackoverflow survey I was very curious to know importance of formal education to become professional developer. Also know if India is good place for developers.

I took the data from stackoverflow survey from 2017 to 2020 and tried to answer the following questions?

1. Is Formal Education necessary to become Professional Developer?
2. As a Software engineer, Is it better to work in India or move to Western countries?
3. Which country has the most number of developers in last 4 years? and where does India stand in terms of total number of developers
4. Will you earn more salary if you contribute to open source?

In short summary is 
- To become Professional developer and earn competitive salary it is better to complete formal education.
- So if you want to earn good amount of salary with Career and Job Satisfaction as you grow experience it is better to move to Western countries.
- According to Stackoverflow, most of the developers on its platform are from United States for each year. US contributes to around 20 percent of developers in the world. And India has second most number of the developers in the world according to Stackoverflow. India contributes to around 10 percent of developers in the world.
- it is good idea to contribute to open source.
